    <h1>Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon</h1>
    <p>
      The men's marathon at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, United
      States, took place on August 30 of that year, over a distance of 24.85
      miles (40 km).
    </p>
    <p>
      The race was run <em>during the hottest part of the day</em> on dusty country roads
      with minimal water supply; while thirty-two athletes representing four
      nations competed, <em>only 14</em> managed to complete the race, which was a
      bizarre affair due to poor organization and officiating. While Fred
      Lorz was greeted as the apparent winner, he was later disqualified as he
      had hitched a ride in a car for part of the race. The actual winner,
      Thomas Hicks, was <strong>near collapse and hallucinating</strong> by the end of the race,
      a side effect of being administered brandy, raw eggs, and strychnine by
      his trainers. The fourth-place finisher, Andarín Carvajal, took a nap
      during the race after eating <strong>spoiled</strong> apples.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      This was the third appearance of the marathon event, which is one of 12
      athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Arthur L.
      Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return, while
      other significant American runners included the winners of the past three
      Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and
      1904 winner Michael Spring.

      <a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href"/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> each made their first appearance in the event, while the United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first
      three Olympic marathons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the
      Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who
      happened to be in St. Louis as part of the South African exhibit at the
      1904 World's Fair. Both had served as long-distance message runners
      during the then-recent Boer War.Although some accounts report that
      both ran barefoot, Mashiani was shoed in photographs taken during the
      event.

    <h2>Competition Format</h2>
    <p>
      The marathon distance had not yet been standardized; in St. Louis, the
      course was 24.85 miles (40 km). St. Louis organizers started the marathon
      at 3 pm, whereas most contemporary marathons start in the early morning to
      take advantage of cooler times of day.

      track;[5] the rest of the course was on dusty country roads, with race
      officials riding in vehicles ahead of and behind the runners: this created
      dust clouds that exacerbated the severely hot and humid conditions,[6]
      with a temperature of around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) at
      start time. The course eventually ended back in the stadium.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The first to arrive at the finish line, after three hours and 13 minutes
      (more than 13 minutes slower than the winning time in 1900) was Fred Lorz.
      After being hailed as the winner, he had his photograph taken with Alice
      Roosevelt, daughter of then-U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, and was
      about to be awarded the gold medal when his subterfuge was revealed.
      <br />
      Lorz, suffering cramps, had actually dropped out of the race after nine
      miles and hitched a ride back to the stadium in a car, waving at
      spectators and runners alike during the ride. When the car broke down at
      the 19th mile, he re-entered the race and jogged across the finish
      line.[6] Upon being confronted by officials, Lorz immediately admitted his
      deception, and despite his claim that he was joking, the AAU responded by
      banning him for life; this was later reduced to a year after it was found
      that he had not intended to defraud. Lorz later won the 1905 Boston
      Marathon. <br />
      Thomas Hicks ended up the winner of the event, although he was aided by
      measures that would not have been permitted in later years. Ten miles from
      the finish, Hicks led the race by a mile and a half, but he had to be
      restrained from stopping and lying down by his trainers. From then until
      the end of the race, Hicks received several doses of strychnine (a common
      rat poison, which stimulates the nervous system in small doses) mixed with
      brandy in an egg white.[3] He continued to battle onwards, hallucinating,
      barely able to walk for most of the course. When he reached the stadium,
      his support team carried him over the line, holding him in the air while
      he shuffled his feet as if still running. Hicks had to be carried off the
      track, and might have died in the stadium had he not been treated by
      several doctors. He lost eight pounds during the course of the
      marathon. <br />
      Another near-fatality during the event was William Garcia of the United
      States. He was found lying in the road along the marathon course with
      severe internal injuries caused by breathing the clouds of dust kicked up
      by the race officials' cars. <br />
      Cuban postman Andarín Carvajal had also joined the marathon, arriving at
      the last minute. After losing all of his money gambling in New Orleans,
      Louisiana, he hitchhiked to St. Louis and had to run the event in street
      clothes that he cut around the legs to make them look like shorts. Not
      having eaten in 40 hours, he saw a spectator eating 2 peaches. He asked if
      he could have the peaches, and the spectator declined. He then stole both
      peaches and ran away. Later, he stopped off in an orchard en route to eat
      some apples, which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused
      him to have strong stomach cramps, and he had to lie down and take a nap.
      Despite falling ill from the apples, and taking a nap, he still managed to
      finish in fourth place.<br />
      During the race, John Lordan, who had won the 1903 Boston Marathon, was
      violently ill after 10 miles and retired, while Sam Mellor, who had won
      the 1902 Boston Marathon, was also overcome by the dust; despite leading
      the field at the halfway mark, Mellor dropped out of the race after 16
      miles.<br />
      Arriving without correct documents, Albert Corey, a French immigrant to
      the United States, is inconsistently listed as performing in a mixed team
      in the four mile team race (with four undisputed Americans) and performing
      for the US in the marathon.<br />
      The South African entrants, Len Taunyane and Jan Mashiani, finished ninth
      and twelfth, respectively: this was a disappointment, as many observers
      were sure Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a
      mile off course by wild dogs.
    </p>
    <h2>Dehydration</h2>
    <p>
      The only two sources of water for the competitors were a water tower at
      six miles and a well at about the 12-mile mark. James E. Sullivan
      was a chief organizer of the Olympics, and decided to allow only one water
      station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was
      conducted in 32 °C (90 °F) heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His
      ostensible reason was to conduct research on "purposeful dehydration",
      even though dehydration is potentially fatal. The marathon ended with the
      worst ratio of entrants to finishers (14 of 32) and by far the slowest
      winning time, 3:28:45, almost 30 minutes slower than the second slowest
      winning time.
